• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
We can specify which files to ignore while uploading code to the repository by defining those file in .gitignore file. 
There are some systems generated files which we don’t want to add in our repository, we can ignore those files while uploading it to the repository.

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Fast forward merge means directly merging to the target (main/master) branch. 
For example, if we have added some feature in one branch, and that branch is ahead from the main branch.
At the time of merge, git figures out the situation and fast-forwards the head to the matched merge commits.
 
• Why should you have different branches?
Generally, the branches are developed when some new feature or functionality is being added to the code. 
But we don't want to combine any untested code to our main branch(which is the working peice of code).
Instead we will test the new feature in another branch, if it works correctly, then we will merge it with the main branch.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
We will have only one Git remote repositories, but in that repository one can have multiple branches such as dev, main, etc.
